//
// THIS FILE (/src/app/checkout/page.tsx) IS CAUSING A BUILD CONFLICT.
// IT CONFLICTS WITH /src/app/(app)/checkout/page.tsx
//
// Next.js is detecting this file as a parallel route to the same path.
//
// TO FIX THE BUILD ERROR: "You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path",
// YOU MUST MANUALLY DELETE THIS FILE (`src/app/checkout/page.tsx`) FROM YOUR PROJECT.
//
// Leaving this file, even empty or modified like this, may still cause build errors
// in some environments if the build system picks it up based on its name and location.
// DELETION IS THE ONLY GUARANTEED SOLUTION.
//
// This content is here to make it non-functional as a Next.js page component.
// It does not export anything and should be ignored by Next.js.
